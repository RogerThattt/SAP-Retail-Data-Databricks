# SAP-Retail-Data-Databricks

Absolutely ‚Äî here's a **structured decomposition** of the article into three distinct lenses:

---

# ‚úÖ **1. Solution Architecture**

## üèóÔ∏è Overview:

A scalable and modular retail data pipeline that ingests SAP source systems into a Lakehouse and transforms them using Delta Live Tables (DLT) in Databricks. This supports analytics, ML, and GenAI use cases.

## üìê Architecture Layers:

| Layer             | Component / Table                                                         | Purpose                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bronze**        | `sap_pos_transactions_bronze`, `sap_product_master_bronze`                | Raw, ingested SAP data via Delta Sharing                         |
| **Silver**        | `product_silver`, `pos_transactions_silver`, `validated_pos_transactions` | Cleaned, enriched, semantically meaningful business data         |
| **Gold** (Future) | Aggregate KPIs, e.g., revenue by store/week                               | Business-friendly summary tables for BI and executive dashboards |

## üß± Platform Stack:

| Layer          | Technology Used            | Justification                                           |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Storage        | Delta Lake (on S3/ADLS)    | ACID transactions, time travel, schema evolution        |
| Compute        | Databricks Runtime (Spark) | Distributed compute optimized for ETL workloads         |
| Transformation | Delta Live Tables (DLT)    | Declarative, scalable pipeline orchestration            |
| Orchestration  | DLT (built-in scheduler)   | Removes need for external tools (Airflow, etc.)         |
| Monitoring     | DLT UI, `_dlt_event_log`   | Native observability, expectation metrics, SLA tracking |

## üîÅ Data Flow Summary:

1. **SAP data lands in Bronze Layer** via Delta Sharing.
2. **DLT pipelines clean, join, and enrich** data into Silver Layer.
3. **DLT expectations validate** records and filter invalid transactions.
4. Resulting Silver Layer is **analytics-ready** for downstream BI/ML.

# üë®‚Äçüî¨ **2. Technical Expertise Required**

## üß† Foundational Knowledge:

* **Distributed Systems**: Spark execution model, Catalyst optimizer, physical DAG planning.
* **Lakehouse Design**: Delta Lake internals (transaction logs, data skipping, schema evolution).
* **Data Modeling**: Kimball-style dimensional modeling (fact/dim tables), Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD).
* **Data Governance**: Lineage tracking, audit trails, schema versioning.

## üî¨ Advanced Topics:

| Skillset                      | Description                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DLT Compiler Model**        | Understanding of how DLT turns decorated Python/SQL functions into Spark DAGs                     |
| **Data Quality Engineering**  | Rule-based validations with expectations, runtime metrics, debugging of failed assertions         |
| **Join Optimization**         | Broadcast join tuning, handling skewed joins, partition strategies                                |
| **Pipeline Observability**    | Interpretation of `_dlt_event_log`, custom alerting, and integration with incident response tools |
| **Change Data Capture (CDC)** | Implementing SCD Type 2 logic and temporal joins (future Gold/Feature Store layer)                |

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:

* **PySpark / SQL**: Core transformation logic
* **DLT Decorators (`@dlt.table`, `@dlt.expect`)**
* **Databricks Workflows**: Managed deployment of DLT
* **Git Integration**: CI/CD for notebooks
* **Unity Catalog (optional)**: Access control, data discovery

# üìÖ **3. Project Management: Schedule & Cost**

## üß≠ Project Timeline (for Silver Layer)

| Phase                          | Deliverables                                      | Estimated Duration |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **1. Ingestion Setup**         | Delta Sharing config, Bronze tables created       | 1‚Äì2 weeks          |
| **2. DLT Pipeline Definition** | Define transformations, expectations in notebooks | 2 weeks            |
| **3. QA & Testing**            | Row count checks, DQ validation, schema checks    | 1 week             |
| **4. Deployment & Monitoring** | Live deployment, DLT observability dashboards     | 1 week             |
| **5. Handoff to Analytics**    | Silver tables exposed to BI/ML consumers          | 0.5‚Äì1 week         |

üïê **Total**: \~6‚Äì7 weeks (1.5 sprints)

## üí∏ Estimated Cost Model

| Component                     | Est. Monthly Cost (for Mid-sized Retail Data)        |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Databricks Jobs Compute**   | \$2,500‚Äì\$4,000 (Standard + DLT enhanced clusters)   |
| **Storage (Bronze+Silver)**   | \~\$300 (compressed Delta)                           |
| **DLT Pipelines (Managed)**   | \~\$1,000 (based on pipeline size/interval)          |
| **Personnel (2‚Äì3 Engineers)** | \~\$30K‚Äì\$45K/month (FTE or contractor blended rate) |
| **Total (1-month burn rate)** | **\~\$35K‚Äì\$50K**                                    |

### üìä Cost Optimization Strategies:

* Use **Triggered mode** (instead of Continuous) for less frequent data.
* Leverage **Auto-Stop clusters** and job-specific compute pools.
* Scope **DLT expectations carefully** to avoid excessive validation compute.

---

### ‚úÖ Business ROI Justification:

* 10x reduction in **time-to-insight** from SAP.
* 70‚Äì80% fewer bugs due to **schema drift or null errors**.
* Unified **ML + BI** foundation from a single Lakehouse source of truth.
* Zero DevOps overhead compared to legacy Spark + Airflow.
